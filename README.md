# 🍪 cookiecutters

My personal collection of [cookiecutters](https://github.com/cookiecutter/cookiecutter).

## Usage

Cookiecutter 1.7 added support for [organizing cookiecutters in directories](https://github.com/cookiecutter/cookiecutter/blob/master/docs/advanced/directories.rst). A particular cookecutter is used by running (replacing `<cookiecutter>` with the directory name).

```console
$ cookiecutter https://github.com/hugolundin/cookiecutters --directory="<cookiecutter>"
```
